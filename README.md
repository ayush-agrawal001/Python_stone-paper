# Python Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The player can choose either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer will randomly select its move. The winner is determined based on the traditional rules of the game.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayush-agrawal001/Python_stone-paper.git
    ```
2. Run the `Stone_Papre.py` file using Python.
    ```bash
    python Stone_Papre.py
    ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to select your move.
4. The game will display the result and update the score.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 to play additional rounds.
6. To quit the game, enter "q" when prompted for your move.

## Example

```bash
(r)ock, (p)aper, (s)cissor or (q)uit: r
rock versus
Its Paper
PC wins
0 win, 1 lose, and 0 tie

(r)ock, (p)aper, (s)cissor or (q)uit: p
paper versus
Its Rock
You win
1 win, 1 lose, and 0 tie
```
## Future Improvements

 1. Add unit tests for game logic.
 2. Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
 3. Extend the game with additional rules or modes.
